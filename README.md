This is my second college project, in the second semester. In it, a system was made that used some things that I have learned in the same period: data types with structures, recursion, dynamic allocation, and more, in order to simulate the operation of a messaging app with email. Perhaps, the project will receive future updates so that it becomes even more faithful to a messaging application...
